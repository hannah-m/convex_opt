\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have shown how support vector machines with soft margins works.
We also discussed how to select the regularization parameter $C$ by looking at the ratio between the number of support vectors and the number of data points used to train the model.
It is worth noting that in this work we explored only linear support vector machines.
The accuracies, specially for the Vertebral Columns Database, can be improved by using the kernel trick \cite{bishop2006pattern}.
This will result in a non-linear decision boundary which, for some problems, is more suitable than assume a linear separability.
