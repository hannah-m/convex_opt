\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have shown how support vector machines works with and without constraints relaxation.
For support vector machines with constraints relaxation we have discussed how to select the regularization parameter $C$ by analyzing the dual variables.
It is worth noting that in this work we explored only linear support vector machines.
The accuracies, specially for the Vertebral Columns Database, can be improved by using the kernel trick \cite{bishop2006pattern}.
This will result in non-linear decision boundaries which, for some tasks, is more suitable than assuming a linear separability.
